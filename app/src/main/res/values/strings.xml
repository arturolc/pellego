    <!--    Metaguiding Beginner -->
    <string name="content_metaguiding_beginner" translatable="false">For two months, I have been trying to decide who makes the best ice cream. I have narrowed it
down to my four favorite manufacturers: Randolph Farms, Goodies, Disco, and Twinkle.
Let\'s start with Randolph Farms. Randolph Farms makes very good ice cream. They have lots of
different flavors, but this doesn\'t really matter to me. That\'s because I always get coffee flavor. They make
the best coffee ice cream in the world. I\'ve never had hot coffee (the drink) but people tell me that
Randolph Farms coffee ice cream tastes just like the real thing. Also, Randolph Farms uses all natural
ingredients to make their ice cream. This is a good idea, I think.
Second, we have Goodies. Goodies makes excellent ice cream. Like Randolph Farms, Goodies
uses all natural ingredients. They only make three different flavors—strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate—
but they make them very well. The strawberry is amazing. Every bite of it reminds me of the strawberries
that I used to pick behind my old house. The vanilla is wonderful. It is very smooth and has a refreshing,
creamy taste. The chocolate is outstanding. It is made with real cocoa beans from Bolivia. I didn\'t know
where Bolivia is so I decided to look for it on a map. After hunting awhile, I discovered that it is in South
America! That\'s a long way to go to get cocoa, so it must be good. I would say that the only drawback to
Goodies ice cream is that they only make three different flavors.
Third, we have Disco. Disco ice cream is okay. They don\'t have many good flavors. Actually, the
only Disco flavor I like is Bubblegum. It is vanilla ice cream with little chunks of bubblegum in it. After you
eat the ice cream, you can blow bubbles with the gum. That\'s pretty fun.
Finally, there is Twinkle. Twinkle ice cream is mediocre. The only good thing about Twinkle is that
it is relatively inexpensive. You can buy a whole carton of twinkle ice cream for $4.50. That\'s only two
weeks allowance for me.</string>

    <string name="content_metaguiding_intermediate" translatable="false">
        First introduced in 1927, The Hardy Boys Mystery Stories are a series of books about the
adventures of brothers Frank and Joe Hardy, teenaged detectives who solve one baffling mystery after
another. The Hardy Boys were so popular among young boys that in 1930 a similar series was created
for girls featuring a sixteen-year-old detective named Nancy Drew. The cover of each volume of The
Hardy Boys states that the author of the series is Franklin W. Dixon; the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories are
supposedly written by Carolyn Keene. Over the years, though, many fans of both series have been
surprised to find out that Franklin W. Dixon and Carolyn Keene are not real people. If Franklin W. Dixon
and Carolyn Keene never existed, then who wrote The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries?
The Hardy Boys and the Nancy Drew books were written through a process called ghostwriting. A
ghostwriter writes a book according to a specific formula. While ghostwriters are paid for writing the
books, their authorship is not acknowledged, and their names do not appear on the published books.
Ghostwriters can write books for children or adults, the content of which is unspecific. Sometimes they
work on book series with a lot of individual titles, such as The Hardy Boys and the Nancy Drew series.
The initial idea for both The Hardy Boys and the Nancy Drew series was developed by a man
named Edward Stratemeyer, who owned a publishing company that specialized in children’s books.
Stratemeyer noticed the increasing popularity of mysteries among adults, and surmised that children
would enjoy reading mysteries about younger detectives with whom they could identify. Stratemeyer first
developed each book with an outline describing the plot and setting. Once he completed the outline,
Stratemeyer then hired a ghostwriter to convert it into a book of slightly over 200 pages. After the
ghostwriter had written a draft of a book, he or she would send it back to Stratemeyer, who would make a
list of corrections and mail it back to the ghostwriter. The ghostwriter would revise the book according to
Stratemeyer’s instructions and then return it to him. Once Stratemeyer approved the book, it was ready
for publication.
Because each series ran for so many years, Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys both had a
number of different ghostwriters producing books; however, the first ghostwriter for each series proved to
be the most influential. The initial ghostwriter for The Hardy Boys was a Canadian journalist named Leslie
McFarlane. A few years later, Mildred A. Wirt, a young writer from Iowa, began writing the Nancy Drew
books. Although they were using prepared outlines as guides, both McFarlane and Wirt developed the
characters themselves. The personalities of Frank and Joe Hardy and Nancy Drew arose directly from
McFarlane’s and Wirt’s imaginations. For example, Mildred Wirt had been a star college athlete and gave
Nancy similar athletic abilities. The ghostwriters were also responsible for numerous plot and setting
details. Leslie McFarlane used elements of his small Canadian town to create Bayport, the Hardy Boys’
fictional hometown.
Although The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew books were very popular with children, not everyone
approved of them. Critics thought their plots were unrealistic and even far-fetched, since most teenagers
did not experience the adventures Frank and Joe Hardy or Nancy Drew did. The way the books were
written also attracted criticism. Many teachers and librarians objected to the ghostwriting process,
claiming it was designed to produce books quickly rather than create quality literature. Some libraries—
including the New York Public Library—even refused to include the books in their children’s collections.
Ironically, this decision actually helped sales of the books, because children simply purchased them when
they were unavailable in local libraries.
Regardless of the debates about their literary merit, each series of books has exerted an
undeniable influence on American and even global culture. Most Americans have never heard of Edward
Stratemeyer, Leslie McFarlane, or Mildred Wirt, but people throughout the world are familiar with Nancy
Drew and Frank and Joe Hardy.

    <!-- Metaguiding Advanced -->
    <string name="content_metaguiding_advanced" translatable="false">Concussions are brain injuries that occur when a person receives a blow to the head, face, or
neck. Although most people who suffer a concussion experience initial bouts of dizziness, nausea, and
drowsiness, these symptoms often disappear after a few days. The long-term effects of concussions,
however, are less understood and far more severe. Recent studies suggest that people who suffer
multiple concussions are at significant risk for developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a
degenerative brain disorder that causes a variety of dangerous mental and emotional problems to arise
weeks, months, or even years after the initial injury. These psychological problems can include
depression, anxiety, memory loss, inability to concentrate, and aggression. In extreme cases, people
suffering from CTE have even committed suicide or homicide. The majority of people who develop these
issues are athletes who participate in popular high-impact sports, especially football. Although new sports
regulations and improvements in helmet technology can help protect players, amateur leagues, the sports
media, and fans all bear some of the responsibility for reducing the incidence of these devastating
injuries.
Improvements in diagnostic technology have provided substantial evidence to link severe—and
often fatal—psychological disorders to the head injuries that players receive while on the field. Recent
autopsies performed on the brains of football players who have committed suicide have shown advanced
cases of CTE in every single victim.
In response to the growing understanding of this danger, the National Football League (NFL) has revised
its safety regulations. Players who have suffered a head injury on the field must undergo a “concussion
sideline assessment”—a series of mental and physical fitness tests—before being allowed back in the
game. In an effort to diminish the amount of head and neck injuries on the field, NFL officials began
enforcing stricter penalty calls for helmet-to-helmet contact, leading with the head, and hitting a
defenseless player. Furthermore, as of 2010, if a player’s helmet is accidentally wrenched from his head
during play, the ball is immediately whistled dead. It is hoped that these new regulations, coupled with
advances in helmet design, will reduce the number of concussions, and thus curb further cases of CTE.
Efforts by the NFL and other professional sports leagues are certainly laudable; we should
commend every attempt to protect the mental and physical health of players. However, new regulations at
the professional level cannot protect amateur players, especially young people. Fatal cases of CTE have
been reported in victims as young as 21. Proper tackling form—using the arms and shoulders to aim for a
player’s midsection—should be taught at an early age. Youth, high school, and college leagues should
also adopt safety rules even more stringent than those of the NFL. Furthermore, young athletes should be
educated about the serious dangers of head injuries at an early age.
Perhaps the most important factor in reducing the number of traumatic brain injuries, however,
lies not with the players, the coaches, or the administrators, but with the media and fans. Sports media
producers have become accustomed to showcasing the most aggressive tackles and the most intense
plays. NFL broadcasts often replay especially violent collisions while the commentators marvel at the
players’ physical prowess. Some sports highlights television programs even feature weekly countdowns
of the “hardest hits.” When the media exalts such dangerous behavior, professionals are rewarded for
injuring each other on the field and amateurs become more likely to try to imitate their favorite NFL
athletes. Announcers, commentators, television producers, and sportswriters should engage in a
collective effort to cease glorifying brutal plays. In turn, fans should stop expecting their favorite players to
put their lives on the line for the purposes of entertainment. Players must not be encouraged to trade their
careers, their health, their happiness, and even their lives for the sake of a game. </string>
