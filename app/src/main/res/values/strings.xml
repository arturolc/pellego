    <string name="content_rsvp_beginner" translatable="false">Fleas are perfectly designed by nature to feast on anything containing blood. Like a shark in the
water or a wolf in the woods, fleas are ideally equipped to do what they do, making them very difficult to
defeat. The bodies of these tiny parasites are extremely hardy and well-suited for their job.
A flea has a very hard exoskeleton, which means the body is covered by a tough, tile-like plate
called a sclerite. Because of these plates, fleas are almost impossible to squish. The exoskeletons of
fleas are also waterproof and shock resistant, and therefore fleas are highly resistant to the sprays and
chemicals used to kill them.
Little spines are attached to this plate. The spines lie flat against the flea’s thin, narrow body as
the flea scurries through an animal’s fur in search of food. However, if anything (like fingers or a selfgrooming pet) tries to pull a flea off through the hair coat, these spines will extend and stick to the fur like
Velcro.
Fleas are some of the best jumpers in the natural world. A flea can jump seven inches, or 150
times its own length, either vertically or horizontally. An equivalent jump for a person would be 555 feet,
the height of the Washington Monument. Fleas can jump 30,000 times in a row without stopping, and they
are able to accelerate through the air at an incredibly high rate—a rate which is over ten times what
humans can withstand in an airplane.
Fleas have very long rear legs with huge thigh muscles and multiple joints. When they get ready
to jump, they fold their long legs up and crouch like a runner on a starting block. Several of their joints
contain a protein called resilin, which helps catapult fleas into the air as they jump, similar to the way a
rubber band provides momentum to a slingshot. Outward facing claws on the bottom of their legs grip
anything they touch when they land.
The adult female flea mates after her first blood meal and begins producing eggs in just 1 to 2
days. One flea can lay up to 50 eggs in one day and over 2,000 in her lifetime. Flea eggs can be seen
with the naked eye, but they are about the size of a grain of salt. Shortly after being laid, the eggs begin
to transform into cocoons. In the cocoon state, fleas are fully developed adults, and will hatch immediately
if conditions are favorable. Fleas can detect warmth, movement, and carbon dioxide in exhaled breath,
and these three factors stimulate them to emerge as new adults. If the flea does not detect appropriate
conditions, it can remain dormant in the cocoon state for extended periods. Under ideal conditions, the
entire life cycle may only take 3 weeks, so in no time at all, pets and homes can become infested.
Because of these characteristics, fleas are intimidating opponents. The best way to control fleas,
therefore, is to take steps to prevent an infestation from ever occurring. </string>

    <string name="content_rsvp_intermediate" translatable="false">In the early 1920s, settlers came to Alaska looking for gold. They traveled by boat to the coastal
towns of Seward and Knik, and from there by land into the gold fields. The trail they used to travel inland
is known today as the Iditarod Trail, one of the National Historic Trails designated by the Congress of the
United States. The Iditarod Trail quickly became a major thoroughfare in Alaska, as the mail and supplies
were carried across this trail. People also used it to get from place to place, including the priests,
ministers, and judges who had to travel between villages. In the winter, the settlers’ only means of travel
down this trail was via dog sled.
Once the gold rush ended, many gold-seekers went back to where they had come from, and
suddenly there was much less travel on the Iditarod Trail. The introduction of the airplane in the late
1920’s meant dog teams were no longer the standard mode of transportation, and of course with the
airplane carrying the mail and supplies, there was less need for land travel in general. The final blow to
the use of the dog teams was the appearance of snowmobiles.
By the mid 1960s, most Alaskans didn’t even know the Iditarod Trail existed, or that dog teams
had played a crucial role in Alaska’s early settlements. Dorothy G. Page, a self-made historian,
recognized how few people knew about the former use of sled dogs as working animals and about the
Iditarod Trail’s role in Alaska’s colorful history. To raise awareness about this aspect of Alaskan history,
she came up with the idea to have a dog sled race over the Iditarod Trail. She presented her idea to an
enthusiastic musher, as dog sled drivers are known, named Joe Redington, Sr. Soon the Pages and the
Redingtons were working together to promote the idea of the Iditarod race.
Many people worked to make the first Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race a reality in 1967. The Aurora
Dog Mushers Club, along with men from the Adult Camp in Sutton, helped clear years of overgrowth from
the first nine miles of the Iditarod Trail. To raise interest in the race, a $25,000 purse was offered, with
Joe Redington donating one acre of his land to help raise the funds. The short race, approximately 27
miles long, was put on a second time in 1969.
After these first two successful races, the goal was to lengthen the race a little further to the ghost
town of Iditarod by 1973. However in 1972, the U.S. Army reopened the trail as a winter exercise, and so
in 1973, the decision was made to take the race all the way to the city of Nome—over 1,000 miles. There
were many who believed it could not be done and that it was crazy to send a bunch of mushers out into
the vast, uninhabited Alaskan wilderness. But the race went! 22 mushers finished that year, and to date
over 400 people have completed it.</string>

    <string name="content_rsvp_advanced" translatable="false">The word euthanasia is of Greek origin and literally means “a good death.” The American
Heritage Dictionary defines it as “the act of killing a person painlessly for reasons of mercy.” Such killing
can be done through active means, such as administering a lethal injection, or by passive means, such as
withholding medical care or food and water.
In recent years in the United States, there have been numerous cases of active euthanasia in the
news. They usually involve the deliberate killing of ill or incapacitated persons by relatives or friends who
plead that they can no longer bear to see their loved ones suffer. Although such killings are a crime, the
perpetrators are often dealt with leniently by our legal system, and the media usually portrays them as
compassionate heroes who take personal risks to save another from unbearable suffering.
The seeming acceptance of active forms of euthanasia is alarming, but we face a bigger, more
insidious threat from passive forms of euthanasia. Every year, in hospitals and nursing homes around the
country, there are growing numbers of documented deaths caused by caregivers withholding lifesustaining care, including food and water, from vulnerable patients who cannot speak for themselves.
While it is illegal to kill someone directly, for example with a gun or knife, in many cases the law
has put its stamp of approval on causing death by omitting needed care. Further, many states have “living
will” laws designed to protect those who withhold treatment, and there have been numerous court rulings
which have approved of patients being denied care and even starved and dehydrated to death.
Because such deaths occur quietly within the confines of hospitals and nursing homes, they can
be kept hidden from the public. Most euthanasia victims are old or very ill, so their deaths might be
attributed to a cause other than the denial of care that really killed them. Further, it is often relatives of the
patient who request that care be withheld. In one court case, the court held that decisions to withhold lifesustaining care may be made not only by close family members but also by a number of third parties, and
that such decisions need not be reviewed by the judicial system if there is no disagreement between
decision makers and medical staff. The court went so far as to rule that a nursing home may not refuse to
participate in the fatal withdrawal of food and water from an incompetent patient!
“Extraordinary” or “heroic” treatment need not be used when the chance for recovery is poor and
medical intervention would serve only to prolong the dying process. But to deny customary and
reasonable care or to deliberately starve or dehydrate someone because he or she is very old or very ill
should not be permitted. Most of the cases coming before the courts do not involve withholding heroic
measures from imminently dying people, but rather they seek approval for denying basic care, such as
administration of food and water, to people who are not elderly or terminally ill, but who are permanently
incapacitated. These people could be expected to live indefinitely, though in an impaired state, if they
were given food and water and minimal treatment.
No one has the right to judge that another’s life is not worth living. The basic right to life should
not be abridged because someone decides that someone else’s quality of life is too low. If we base the
right to life on quality of life standards, there is no logical place to draw the line.
To protect vulnerable patients, we must foster more positive attitudes towards people with serious
and incapacitating illnesses and conditions. Despite the ravages of their diseases, they are still our fellow
human beings and deserve our care and respect. We must also enact
positive legislation that will protect vulnerable people from those who consider their lives meaningless or
too costly to maintain and who would cause their deaths by withholding life-sustaining care such as food
and water.</string>

    <string name="content_metaguiding_beginner" translatable="false">For two months, I have been trying to decide who makes the best ice cream. I have narrowed it
down to my four favorite manufacturers: Randolph Farms, Goodies, Disco, and Twinkle.
Let\'s start with Randolph Farms. Randolph Farms makes very good ice cream. They have lots of
different flavors, but this doesn\'t really matter to me. That\'s because I always get coffee flavor. They make
the best coffee ice cream in the world. I\'ve never had hot coffee (the drink) but people tell me that
Randolph Farms coffee ice cream tastes just like the real thing. Also, Randolph Farms uses all natural
ingredients to make their ice cream. This is a good idea, I think.
Second, we have Goodies. Goodies makes excellent ice cream. Like Randolph Farms, Goodies
uses all natural ingredients. They only make three different flavors—strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate—
but they make them very well. The strawberry is amazing. Every bite of it reminds me of the strawberries
that I used to pick behind my old house. The vanilla is wonderful. It is very smooth and has a refreshing,
creamy taste. The chocolate is outstanding. It is made with real cocoa beans from Bolivia. I didn\'t know
where Bolivia is so I decided to look for it on a map. After hunting awhile, I discovered that it is in South
America! That\'s a long way to go to get cocoa, so it must be good. I would say that the only drawback to
Goodies ice cream is that they only make three different flavors.
Third, we have Disco. Disco ice cream is okay. They don\'t have many good flavors. Actually, the
only Disco flavor I like is Bubblegum. It is vanilla ice cream with little chunks of bubblegum in it. After you
eat the ice cream, you can blow bubbles with the gum. That\'s pretty fun.
Finally, there is Twinkle. Twinkle ice cream is mediocre. The only good thing about Twinkle is that
it is relatively inexpensive. You can buy a whole carton of twinkle ice cream for $4.50. That\'s only two
weeks allowance for me.</string>

        First introduced in 1927, The Hardy Boys Mystery Stories are a series of books about the
adventures of brothers Frank and Joe Hardy, teenaged detectives who solve one baffling mystery after
another. The Hardy Boys were so popular among young boys that in 1930 a similar series was created
for girls featuring a sixteen-year-old detective named Nancy Drew. The cover of each volume of The
Hardy Boys states that the author of the series is Franklin W. Dixon; the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories are
supposedly written by Carolyn Keene. Over the years, though, many fans of both series have been
surprised to find out that Franklin W. Dixon and Carolyn Keene are not real people. If Franklin W. Dixon
and Carolyn Keene never existed, then who wrote The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries?
The Hardy Boys and the Nancy Drew books were written through a process called ghostwriting. A
ghostwriter writes a book according to a specific formula. While ghostwriters are paid for writing the
books, their authorship is not acknowledged, and their names do not appear on the published books.
Ghostwriters can write books for children or adults, the content of which is unspecific. Sometimes they
work on book series with a lot of individual titles, such as The Hardy Boys and the Nancy Drew series.
The initial idea for both The Hardy Boys and the Nancy Drew series was developed by a man
named Edward Stratemeyer, who owned a publishing company that specialized in children’s books.
Stratemeyer noticed the increasing popularity of mysteries among adults, and surmised that children
would enjoy reading mysteries about younger detectives with whom they could identify. Stratemeyer first
developed each book with an outline describing the plot and setting. Once he completed the outline,
Stratemeyer then hired a ghostwriter to convert it into a book of slightly over 200 pages. After the
ghostwriter had written a draft of a book, he or she would send it back to Stratemeyer, who would make a
list of corrections and mail it back to the ghostwriter. The ghostwriter would revise the book according to
Stratemeyer’s instructions and then return it to him. Once Stratemeyer approved the book, it was ready
for publication.
Because each series ran for so many years, Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys both had a
number of different ghostwriters producing books; however, the first ghostwriter for each series proved to
be the most influential. The initial ghostwriter for The Hardy Boys was a Canadian journalist named Leslie
McFarlane. A few years later, Mildred A. Wirt, a young writer from Iowa, began writing the Nancy Drew
books. Although they were using prepared outlines as guides, both McFarlane and Wirt developed the
characters themselves. The personalities of Frank and Joe Hardy and Nancy Drew arose directly from
McFarlane’s and Wirt’s imaginations. For example, Mildred Wirt had been a star college athlete and gave
Nancy similar athletic abilities. The ghostwriters were also responsible for numerous plot and setting
details. Leslie McFarlane used elements of his small Canadian town to create Bayport, the Hardy Boys’
fictional hometown.
Although The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew books were very popular with children, not everyone
approved of them. Critics thought their plots were unrealistic and even far-fetched, since most teenagers
did not experience the adventures Frank and Joe Hardy or Nancy Drew did. The way the books were
written also attracted criticism. Many teachers and librarians objected to the ghostwriting process,
claiming it was designed to produce books quickly rather than create quality literature. Some libraries—
including the New York Public Library—even refused to include the books in their children’s collections.
Ironically, this decision actually helped sales of the books, because children simply purchased them when
they were unavailable in local libraries.
Regardless of the debates about their literary merit, each series of books has exerted an
undeniable influence on American and even global culture. Most Americans have never heard of Edward
Stratemeyer, Leslie McFarlane, or Mildred Wirt, but people throughout the world are familiar with Nancy
Drew and Frank and Joe Hardy.

    <string name="content_metaguiding_advanced" translatable="false">Concussions are brain injuries that occur when a person receives a blow to the head, face, or
neck. Although most people who suffer a concussion experience initial bouts of dizziness, nausea, and
drowsiness, these symptoms often disappear after a few days. The long-term effects of concussions,
however, are less understood and far more severe. Recent studies suggest that people who suffer
multiple concussions are at significant risk for developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a
degenerative brain disorder that causes a variety of dangerous mental and emotional problems to arise
weeks, months, or even years after the initial injury. These psychological problems can include
depression, anxiety, memory loss, inability to concentrate, and aggression. In extreme cases, people
suffering from CTE have even committed suicide or homicide. The majority of people who develop these
issues are athletes who participate in popular high-impact sports, especially football. Although new sports
regulations and improvements in helmet technology can help protect players, amateur leagues, the sports
media, and fans all bear some of the responsibility for reducing the incidence of these devastating
injuries.
Improvements in diagnostic technology have provided substantial evidence to link severe—and
often fatal—psychological disorders to the head injuries that players receive while on the field. Recent
autopsies performed on the brains of football players who have committed suicide have shown advanced
cases of CTE in every single victim.
In response to the growing understanding of this danger, the National Football League (NFL) has revised
its safety regulations. Players who have suffered a head injury on the field must undergo a “concussion
sideline assessment”—a series of mental and physical fitness tests—before being allowed back in the
game. In an effort to diminish the amount of head and neck injuries on the field, NFL officials began
enforcing stricter penalty calls for helmet-to-helmet contact, leading with the head, and hitting a
defenseless player. Furthermore, as of 2010, if a player’s helmet is accidentally wrenched from his head
during play, the ball is immediately whistled dead. It is hoped that these new regulations, coupled with
advances in helmet design, will reduce the number of concussions, and thus curb further cases of CTE.
Efforts by the NFL and other professional sports leagues are certainly laudable; we should
commend every attempt to protect the mental and physical health of players. However, new regulations at
the professional level cannot protect amateur players, especially young people. Fatal cases of CTE have
been reported in victims as young as 21. Proper tackling form—using the arms and shoulders to aim for a
player’s midsection—should be taught at an early age. Youth, high school, and college leagues should
also adopt safety rules even more stringent than those of the NFL. Furthermore, young athletes should be
educated about the serious dangers of head injuries at an early age.
Perhaps the most important factor in reducing the number of traumatic brain injuries, however,
lies not with the players, the coaches, or the administrators, but with the media and fans. Sports media
producers have become accustomed to showcasing the most aggressive tackles and the most intense
plays. NFL broadcasts often replay especially violent collisions while the commentators marvel at the
players’ physical prowess. Some sports highlights television programs even feature weekly countdowns
of the “hardest hits.” When the media exalts such dangerous behavior, professionals are rewarded for
injuring each other on the field and amateurs become more likely to try to imitate their favorite NFL
athletes. Announcers, commentators, television producers, and sportswriters should engage in a
collective effort to cease glorifying brutal plays. In turn, fans should stop expecting their favorite players to
put their lives on the line for the purposes of entertainment. Players must not be encouraged to trade their
careers, their health, their happiness, and even their lives for the sake of a game. </string>
